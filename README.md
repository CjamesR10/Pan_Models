# Pan_Models

This repo is still a work in progress. For an example of using llama-3, see test_llama.py. Make sure you set your HF_TOKEN environment variable before running the script, or you won't be able to download the model from huggingface. Either that, or ensure that the 'token' file in your HF_HOME directory exists and has read permission for the Llama-3 repo.
